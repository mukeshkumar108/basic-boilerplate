# Simple Boilerplate

A simple HTML / SCSS boilerplate. Saves times on common repeated processes, so you can just start and code.

Opinionated to my workflow.

## Intended Functionality

* basic CSS defaults
* basic SCSS module structure
* basic folder structure 
* live server to watch & build changes
* build process
